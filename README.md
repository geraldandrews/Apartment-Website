# Apartment-Website

### Live Site: https://thenorthwinds.netlify.app/

## Project Type: Personal
## Programs Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AOS JS
## Date created: 2023

## Description:
In this project, I decided to create a one page front-end website from scratch of an actual apartment housing community located in Wytheville, VA where I once lived for a few years as a child. To build this website, I used HTML and CSS for the layout and responsiveness of the site and JavaScript for the functionality of the site which includes the navigation and toggle button on smart phones and tablets, smooth scroll, and a back to top button as the user scrolls down the page. Finally, I use CSS animations for the fade in effect in the header and the AOS JS library for animations in the body of the website.
